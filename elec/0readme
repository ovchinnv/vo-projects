4/18 : trying fortran to see what kind of speedup is possible over MATLAB ; thus far, much faster, but not computing grid values,
since we technically do not need them in the production code

(1) machine for rho
(2) elec potential energy matches, but not gradients ; there is a mismatched factor of -2 in one of the codes
(3) the fortran version is actually correct; the x2 factor is real ; confirmed by FD and also theory ; fixed matlab

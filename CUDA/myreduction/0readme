9.2017 : a bit confused as to why need to specify VPT if the kernel decides when to stop adding ... seems OK, however
NOT very fast, unfortunately


NOTE : discovered that for large numbers, the float reduction is not accurate  -- gives bis discrepancies between gpu/cpu;
however, I changed the type to integer, and all works ; therefore, the floating point accuracy is to blame

GPU is faster, but the overhead of data transfer is large

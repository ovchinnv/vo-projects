6.21.6 : 
-increase Langevin friction to facilitate equilibration (first, go up from 1 to 10/ps)
-increase #bins for interpolation to 100 on each side (out of 1000)
-implement exactly reflective BC at boundaries (improves distribution !)

overall, I stil do not recover the exact prescribed distribution ; this can either be due to convergence (dE term is very large)
or due to the computation of the dE term

the first is easy to check; will do so here;
discovered that using the adaptive averaging appears to help : I guess the initial portion of the history must be discarded
however, by itself, this does not solve the problem ; could the nonuniformity of the grid in T-space be the problem ?
In this case, could maintain the (uniform) grid in T-space

seems to be converging with time -- ? YES : after 100ns, the correct powerlaw (-1) is essentially matched

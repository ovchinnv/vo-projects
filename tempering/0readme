6/2/16 : creating tempering plugin for acemd ; will then separate into a general code and an acemd plugin part
so that the general code could be used with other MD codes
duplicating some files, such as c binding definitions; they should all be placed in a common directory
also, aceplug.h should be taken from acemd distribution; it is currently part of the code

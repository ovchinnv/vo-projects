6/2/16 : creating tempering plugin for acemd ; will then separate into a general code and an acemd plugin part
so that the general code could be used with other MD codes
duplicating some files, such as c binding definitions; they should all be placed in a common directory
also, aceplug.h is taken from acemd distribution; it is _NOT_ part of the code

5/9/17 : renaming some functions to emphasize that the code is generic, i.e., not just for acemd; acemd interface part of library

10/18 : griddata is completely generic -- i.e. is it only a data stucture ; I should change the name of the quantity "energy"
to something more generic, as well. Might also be nice to move this into a separate directory ?
For now, will implement adaptive RLES separately form the code here

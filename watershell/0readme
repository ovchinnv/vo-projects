11/17 : this code is based on molecule, string, and tempering modules ; much code duplication
note that ACEMD passes forces in single precision, while other codes, e.g. openmm, use double precision

12/17 : reconcile input options when qminimum_distance on/off
also, really should have a neighbor list to get the last dregs of performance out;
the list is protein atoms is already (almost) sorted ; however, we need to avoid looping over all atoms for the waters that
are outside the surface ; 
e.g. when going over entire list without early quits, record the location of the minimum ; when going over list with early quits,
go only up to that location (plus some buffer offset, just in case); this of course works when the list is pretty well sorted;
it is sorted gradually using bubble sort ; the frequency of calling the full routine that performs the partial sort is 
optimizable

a similar algorithm is possible for the original algorithm, where one has to find the position beyond which all atoms are
outside the cutoff

also, when bubble sorting the full list, start from the end ; that way the minimum is guaranteed to be at the beginning

12/4/17 : when subtracting net force, as well as net torque, the water structure is destabilized ; 
it seems that at best we should only be subtracting net torque

perhaps another way of subtracting net force is to do it before torque subtraction by the simplest method

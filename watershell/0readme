11/17 : this code is based on molecule, string, and tempering modules ; much code duplication
note that ACEMD passes forces in single precision, while other codes, e.g. openmm, use double precision

12/17 : reconcile input options when qminimum_distance on/off
also, really should have a neighbor list to get the last dregs of performance out;
the list is protein atoms is already (almost) sorted ; however, we need to avoid looping over all atoms for the waters that
are outside the surface ; 
e.g. when going over entire list without early quits, record the location of the minimum ; when going over list with early quits,
go only up to that location (plus some buffer offset, just in case); this of course works when the list is pretty well sorted;
it is sorted gradually using bubble sort ; the frequency of calling the full routine that performs the partial sort is 
optimizable

a similar algorithm is possible for the original algorithm, where one has to find the position beyond which all atoms are
outside the cutoff

also, when bubble sorting the full list, start from the end ; that way the minimum is guaranteed to be at the beginning

12/4/17 : when subtracting net force, as well as net torque, the water structure is destabilized ; 
it seems that at best we should only be subtracting net torque

perhaps another way of subtracting net force is to do it before torque subtraction by the simplest method

NOTE : running a long mindist simulation with torque removal leads to instability, similar to the mindist simulation without
torque removal ; however, the interesting fact is that the structure looks fine in the trajectory ; this means that whatever
instability set in, it happened rapidly at the end ; there was the "matrix singular error again" ; further, the RMSD looks good
In short, the problem seems to be with matrix inversion the torque removal algorithm
another possibility is "run of the mill" instability in acemd ; 

12/6/17 : running with the original density method : the protein begins to spin at around 10 ns, similarly to the mindist method
stopping after ~8ns ; I think I wilil need a torque correction here, too; except that I will have to fix it

to do : implement a sort that preserves indexing, so that the solute list can be sorted at the beginning

to do : compute maximum corrective force used by the torque removal algorithm ; as a test and a safeguard against crashes

2/5/18 : force correction algorithm leads to unphysical coordinates ; here trying to use to surface group to corect force ; torque correction should be ok
RESULTS : ok ? but not if reference distance too small

5/18 : barostat does not seem to work well ; bugs still possible, but I wonder whether a densostat is the better way

Invocation of the string method modules.

Description.

The string method suite relies on a special communication scheme that is
provided by the module multicom (MCOM). This module is to be called
prior to any string calculation to define the message-passing
communicators for communication within and between string nodes. (This
implies that the string method requires the message passing interface,
which in a charmm compilation is provided by the keyword M). A special
command to MCOM will create a series of local communicators to handle
communication between different cpus associated with the same string
image, and a communicator for communication between different string
images.

Subsequent calls to string method initialization routines will check
that the appropriate communicators have been set up and print a status
message or a warning.

Syntax.

MCOM STRIng <int> BY <int>

STRIng [ ZERO <character*> |
         SM0K <character*> |
         COLV <character*> |
         FTSM <character*> |
         OPEN [UNIT <int>] -
              [NAME <character*>] -
              [{UNFOrmatted|FILE|FORMatted|CARD}] -
              [{READ|WRITe|APPEnd}] -
              [CLOSe]


Command description.

MCOM STRIng <int>(i) BY <int>(j) Create MPI communicators for (i) string
replicas, with (j) CPU cores assigned to each replica.  The total number
of CPUs in the parallel run (e.g. the number given to the mpirun command
must be no less than (i)*(j), otherwise an error message will be
printed.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

[SM0K|ZERO] Invoke the command parser for the zero-temperature string
method (SM0K subcommands are documented elsewhere in this file)

[COLV] Invoke the command parser for the string method in collective
variables (COLV subcommands are documented elsewhere)

[FTSM] Invoke the zero-temperature string command parser (FTSM
subcommands are documented elsewhere)

[OPEN] Open a file on the root node of each string image.  I/O
specification is the same as that described for general CHARMM I/O (see
io.doc). This STRIng OPEN command is different from the OPEN command
because the latter will only open a file on the root note of the
parallel run.

[CLOSe] Close file unit on the root node of each string image.

12/15 : window dynamics : (to be documented further)

window width specification : dwin=1 means window width is D, where D is interreplica distance (from ftsm_var)
this means that for inner points, where the local metric is 2D, dwin is HALVED (old_unit_D = 1/2 new_unit_2D); confirmed this from addforce routine
This scaling is historical, coming from the diffusion paper.  However, it is unfortunate because other quantities, such as dpar, dperp, kpar, kperp
are specified in the "local" metric, i.e. per 2D [conversion to per 1D at endpoints is done automatically in addforce]

What needs to be done : 
(1) a description of this in the code/ manual (both would be good)
(2) perhaps a change to input so that the specification of all quantities is, by default, per D, rather than per 2D
(3) the ability to specify dwin in other units (i.e. absolute) should perhaps be added

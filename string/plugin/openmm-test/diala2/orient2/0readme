1/2/18 : preserve orientation of two dialas with overlap, based on charmm example
cannot test ACEMD because it does not allow arbitrary custom exclusion lists;
with OPENMM, the file charmmpsffile.py seems to simply omit the exclusion list section;
I will have to modify it to add the functionality, but it is hopeful;

Modified charmmpsffile.py ; nonbonded energy is twice that of the monomer, but does not agree with CHARMM, presumably because of different switching functions
Seems to work !

4/16:
trying to implement replica exchange functionality on top of short runs of ACEMD usign charmm

NOTE : need to implement "ftsm addforce" (or add it to be executed by 'ftsm calc') so that ftsm energies could be computable at script
NOTE : a possibility is to read new ftsm coordinates in the ftsm_done context

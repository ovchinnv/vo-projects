4/16:
trying to implement replica exchange functionality on top of short runs of ACEMD usign charmm

NOTE : need to implement "ftsm addforce" (or add it to be executed by 'ftsm calc') so that ftsm energies could be computable at script
NOTE : a possibility is to read new ftsm coordinates in the ftsm_done context

NOTE : there is a hack here invonving contexts: technically nested contexts are ot allowed ; however when we read a ftsm datafile, 
we switch to the "ftsm" context, and subsequently have to return to the previous -- main -- context ; however the exec function ignores this
and continues in its own context

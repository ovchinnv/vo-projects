5.9.16 : ftsm with short restarts but no replica exchange ; trying to track down a bug that (seemingly) destroys positions of restrained atoms ;
perhaps the string is simply unstable for come configs, but in that case, I should see this here

 (1) restarting looks file
 (2) appending dcds looks file
 (3) pressure fluctuates but unclear whether this is the culprit
 (4) NEED to run longer (comparably yo REX case) to ascertain that this case is OK
     THEN, also need a control in which see bad behaviour in a similar run but with rex

 CHECK to make sure fts energies are computed correctly
 
 Looks like there are signs that the structures do fall apart for certain replicas ; for example, replica 2 wants to separate ! YES -- rab _does_ come off;
 Also : tested REX energies : there was a bug but it only affected endpoints ; do not think it was relevant to our problem
 
 To rule out pressure, should run without barostat (or very long sampling, but preferably NVT)
 However, as noted elsewhere, the cell sizes have small fluctuations ; on the other hand, how small is small ?
 
 Sould also consider the possibility that the path (which was optimized in a quick + dirty way) is simply bad.

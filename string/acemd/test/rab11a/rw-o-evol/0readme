5.16 : first try at ftsm with evolution
Note that the evolution might be too rapid (mem=0.999)
Also note that the exponential evolution technically will not converge
(For that I will probably need to switch to averaging the string)


6.16 : switching to averaging to produce a smoother string
(note that I may be overestimating the number of average samples by 100 at each run because of evoskip)

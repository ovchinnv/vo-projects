5.9.16 -- "BAD" results; see below

5.4.16 : implementing annealing in replica exchange temp
5.5.16 : first attempt failed, probably (possibly) because the openmp implementation does not pass grad test in parallel ; rerunning

NOTES from acer :

strange : (1) the coor files do not show that the coordinate of restrained atoms remain in one place ;(2)  however, they can be aligned, 
and show very minor fluctuations, suggesting, perhaps, that the restraints are in fact being honored ; (3) furthermore, and _importantly_, 
the rab protein is not stably bound to fip here -- coming off at various points in the (ACEMD) string ; perhaps some kind of bug in ACEMD ?
Should try without rex just to make sure ; could the restarting procedure itself be to blame ?

What does the unrestrained MD show ?
 (1) open complex : very good stability (was run for much longer than the string here !)
 
 an interesting observation is that when running equilibrium acemd of fip2ro complex, the .coor restart files also do not
 respect the positions of restrained atoms (even though the dcd files look correct);
  -- this sugegsts that acemd does whatever it pleases with the coordinates -- restraints must be applied _after_ wrapping
  -- one possible explanation for what I've observed is that wrapping is done on rab, so when fip moves away, it can be wrapped regardless of whether
     restraints are present

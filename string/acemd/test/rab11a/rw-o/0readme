5.20.16 : stopping because the simulation results are clearly not correct
(the FE profile increases monotonically, and I do not believe this is a convergence issue)
Need to understand what is happening here. Trying the following approaches :

 (1) rerun with the initial string (to see whether the string itself is somehow pathological)
 (2) reduce the number of orientation/forcing atoms (to see if the resolution matters)
 (3) try a better path (more smooth in energy) ; this is a complement to (1)

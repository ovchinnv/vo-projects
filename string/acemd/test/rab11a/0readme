5.9.16 -- in -rex : "BAD" results; see below

5.4.16 : implementing annealing in replica exchange temp
5.5.16 : first attempt failed, probably (possibly) because the openmp implementation does not pass grad test in parallel ; rerunning

NOTES from acer :

strange : (1) the coor files do not show that the coordinate of restrained atoms remain in one place ;(2)  however, they can be aligned, 
and show very minor fluctuations, suggesting, perhaps, that the restraints are in fact being honored ; (3) furthermore, and _importantly_, 
the rab protein is not stably bound to fip here -- coming off at various points in the (ACEMD) string ; perhaps some kind of bug in ACEMD ?
Should try without rex just to make sure ; could the restarting procedure itself be to blame ?

What does the unrestrained MD show ?
 (1) open complex : very good stability (was run for much longer than the string here !)
 
 an interesting observation is that when running equilibrium acemd of fip2ro complex, the .coor restart files also do not
 respect the positions of restrained atoms (even though the dcd files look correct);
  -- this sugegsts that acemd does whatever it pleases with the coordinates -- restraints must be applied _after_ wrapping
  -- one possible explanation for what I've observed is that wrapping is done on rab, so when fip moves away, it can be wrapped regardless of whether
     restraints are present
     
     
NOREX :
5.9.16 : ftsm with short restarts but no replica exchange ; trying to track down a bug that (seemingly) destroys positions of restrained atoms ;
perhaps the string is simply unstable for come configs, but in that case, I should see this here

 (1) restarting looks file
 (2) appending dcds looks file
 (3) pressure fluctuates but unclear whether this is the culprit
 (4) NEED to run longer (comparably yo REX case) to ascertain that this case is OK
     THEN, also need a control in which see bad behaviour in a similar run but with rex

 CHECK to make sure fts energies are computed correctly
 
 Looks like there are signs that the structures do fall apart for certain replicas ; for example, replica 2 wants to separate ! YES -- rab _does_ come off;
 Also : tested REX energies : there was a bug but it only affected endpoints ; do not think it was relevant to our problem
 
 To rule out pressure, should run without barostat (or very long sampling, but preferably NVT)
 However, as noted elsewhere, the cell sizes have small fluctuations ; on the other hand, how small is small ?
 
 Sould also consider the possibility that the path (which was optimized in a quick + dirty way) is simply bad.
 
 5.11.16 : there seems to be no purpose to the norex simulation, since the qualitative (dissociation) behavior is the same as in the rex case
 

 5.14.16 : rw-o : removing fip to compute the FE along the _same_ string invilving rab only
 NOTE :  for this calculation, eveything is the same except for the initial structures, which are obtained by resolvation
  AND selection atom indices (alist.vmd)
  Further, need to stabilize the barostat -- initial geom not cubic, acemd grows box
  To stabilize the barostat when the initial box is noncubic, use high pressure relaxation (10000) and a lower than 4 timestep 
  the problem of box growing gets worse with higher anisotropy ; e.g. dt=1
  
  In the future, I should modify the water pruning algorithm to take off waters off each of the 6 sides (3 sides might be enough too)
  Doing this now; it wll make simulations much more efficient; I do not see very much water motion in the anisotropic boxes
 
  Running better now; set the box size to about 71^3, and it equilibrates to 68 in under 10K iterations

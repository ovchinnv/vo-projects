5.16 : using directly path obtained from ZTS

oops ! ran out of disk space just before (unconverged) completion at run 490/500 ; moved scratch to /bkp2 and linked here

8/16 : note that dprp = 7 here, meaning that the sampled orthogonal space is quite large ; perhaps this is why the result does not converge

2/27/17 : the patches generated here are to be applied in the root directory of the NAMD source code with -p0
2/27/17 : modified 2.10 patch by hand to work for 2.12
4/27/17 : note that sm_acemd.ftn and sm_namd.ftn are essentially identical, and should really be combined into a single
interface file; otherwise, as the number of supported codes is added, e.g. OPENMM, there will be more files;
further, it seems possible to make a single library that supports several, if not all, external MD packages

NOTE: one thing to keep in mind is that the forces used by some codes, e.g. ACEMD, is in single precision;
this is reflected in the function declarations and prototypes ; may need to provide overloaded functions
and interfaces ; however, one possibility of dealing with this is to convert to double precision in ACEMD;
before I do that, I should check how this impacts performance

4/18 :  with respect to the above, I declare a single and a double precision array, then pass a flag to the FORTRAN side
that indicates whether to populate the double of the single-prec. array

smcv_init { ! when this stack executes, coordinates are not defined, hence smcv_first context
!=======================

 : add dist_com -
    sele atomid 9 end -
    sele atomid 99 end

!========================
 : set -                    ! set some parameters pertaining to CVs
       all -                ! index spec: all means all CVs

       fbwidth @fbw         ! width of flat-bottom potential (zero by default)
 : set ind 1 CVZ @dref col main ! set CV value for cv #1 in main column (where the target restraint sits after equilibration for reeq iterations)
!=======================================

smcv_first { ! this stack is executed at first step of dynamics
!========================
 : fill col old             ! compute CV values from coordinates ; store in the "old", x-compatible, set (for SMD)
                            ! since coordinates are only available when the plugin is called from dynamics, defer_init_dyna=yes is important for this to work

! : test grad step 0.1      ! test gradients
!=======================================
 : dyna -                ! parameters for dynamics

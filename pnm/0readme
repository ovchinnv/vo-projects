7/2014 : Plastic network model.  This code belongs to the CHARMM project. It has been moved to this directory to facilitate integration
with the latest CHARMM version (currently, c40). The problem in a nutshell is that string code has to be in its own directory; however, 
string relies on vectors code, which is thus part of the string directory; I do not want to make PNM depend on the string directory, so 
using tricks here to produce a self-contained pnm CHARMM source

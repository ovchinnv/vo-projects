4/12/12:

The purpose of the projects directory is to host the source code of all of my projects and codes in a portable way.  Much of the development I have done
has been tied to a specific software application.  This creates additional work when I want to transfer a particular code segment to another program, work that
exists at the source code level, and work that requires familiarity with both the new and the old software (from which the code is being ported).

What I am doing here, is taking out the source code I have written for a specific application, rewriting it to be as generic as possible, and then providing
Makefiles that generate the source code taylored to a specific allication (e.g. by relying, quite heavily at times, on preprocessor macros)

This is clearly `reverse engineering' in the sense that I am recreating a general object from a particular object, but my hope is that it will permit 
greater reusability of the existing code.

The present strategy will also permit me to use one copy of the `master' source code, from which particular source codes are generated automatically. This is desirable
for obvious reasons.

Existing codes _will_ require modifications, but these modifications _will_ be minor.  At the present moment, I am only concerning myself with taking the source code `out'
Modification of existing code will be done as needed.

(be aware of PBC and how this applies to epsilon interpolation) - IGNORING THIS ISSUE FOR NOW 

main solution subroutine inside MG - in progress ; 
2D done -- optimizing smoothers
3D works ; in process of adding smoothers

once the first version works (as a proof of concept):
1) optimize calculations for speed -- pretty much done on CPU
2) translate some routines to C (can be done one by one, linking against C object files)
3) combine C routines into CUDA kernel(s)

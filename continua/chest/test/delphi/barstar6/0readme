7/5/19 : 
NOTES for compating with delphi
(1) grid energy in Delphi does not seem to be an integral, i.e. it is missing dV=dx*dy*dz
(2) With proper choice of gridding params, it might be possible to get consistent eners
Need to setup an automatic, "resolution-independent" test case

7/6/19 : looks like found some parameters to reproduce the delphi energies ; using a smoothed charge def;

12.2013 : to become a self-contained test-case
11.17 : test.dat is the current test case wiht traf ; note that paraview does not automatically recognize file types correctly;
this is problematic, because it will attemmpt to read a pdb file and fail ; you have to change its extensions to soething else, 
ao that it can be opened manually ; same with plot3d files

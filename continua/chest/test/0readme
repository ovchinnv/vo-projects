9/17 : GPU-accelerated 3D problem

Single precision ; 4 full MG cycles ; 8 smoothing iterations ; stretched mesh in all directions


System		GPU(s)		CPU(s)		Notes:

98x98x98	0.042		1.015		4 levels
128x128x128	0.071		2.389		6 levels
256x256x256	0.368		19.0		7 levels
512x256x256	0.706		37.7		7 levels


note tha tile size effects are very strange ; I should have a more robust method of determining valid sizes ; for example, 48^3 is probably not supported
because the coarsest grid is 6^3, but the tile size is 4^2 x 1

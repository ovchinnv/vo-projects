3.2013 : beginning integration of fluids code ; these notes outline the current plan

1) some functionality involving the poisson solver and the fluids solver will be shared/merged (such as grids/bc's); these modules will
probably be in a separate directory; the chest/fluids modules will use those modules;

for now, I am creating an "eddie" directory that will house fluids code; as it develops, will see how to rearrange more logically

Also, for now, the state stores variables in different contexts, but this is just a blueprint for greater flexibility in the future.
Also, I assume the existence of one instance of 'size' which has the dimensions and a communicator (this is implicit when you include 'size'); 
in the future, the code should allow multiple communicators associated with different contexts

6.2013: NOTE : driver.ftn obsolete
strange : the cuda code works the same whether or not BC are applied -- maybe they are applied incorrectly ?
there is evidence that actual RB works because in that case the residual is deterministic

6.19 : cuda mg solver does not work without __DSHMEM, and does not work with __MGTEX ; need to debug

reverse : simply reverse loops
rb -- red/black (2D) only
unroll -- perform several smoothing interations without calling bc ; this means that the support shrinks with each "inner iteration" ; 
          then, do an 'outer' iteration, whereby the missing boundary point updated are 'filled in'
          this method (which is implemented for 2D thus far) actually takes longer ...
rb-tiled -- red / black GS ; use tiles ; this is a GPU "prototype" which is NOT yet working in 3D -- TODO !

NOTE : precomputing indices make no speed difference ; if anything, computing on the fly increases speed marginally
for some reason, cannot use SOR with GS/CUDA two-pass red/black ! In fact, it's convergence is more like Jacobi
Also: does not matter whether BC applied ! why ? this sjould be true for dirichletg (ghost point) but not regular !

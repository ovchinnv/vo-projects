NOTES from ACEMD implementation :
4/24/17 : convergence rather abysmal ; cannot even get anything
resembling the correct profile ; one possibility is to compute dF/dz
rather than the histogram. Yes, this gives much better results

One point that seems to be very important is to have the dynamics evolving slowly enough to keep the temperature
in the desired range ; otherwise, the FE profile is wrong (this might be because the effective temperature is much higher for the
resulting non equilibrium process)

Overall, with this method, extreme care must be taken to keep the system at equilibrium; perhaps one could
use a thermostat with very low coupling and monitor the kinetic temperature


2/10/2023 : reasonable convergence in openmm ; however, I suspect that the slightly lowish barrier is caused by the effectively higher temperature

5.14 : utilities to create charmm patches; here for "safekeeping"
mkdiff - make a CHARMM patch tree from two sources
mknew - make a new tree with only the files that need patching; needs a patch tree and an original source
mkpatch - similar to mknew, except patches the existing tree using the patch tree

1.20.12: 
the source is in 'bestfit.ftn'. This file is preprocessed depending on the target source. To make bestfit.src (CHARMM) use 'make charmm'

1.24.12: found a tough test case

ifort: optimization flags do not make a difference

8.15.12: for some cases, double precision error can be as high as 5e-7 for UVU^T - A 

for single precision, the errors can currently be very large, e.g. O(1)
thus, at present, and until I improve the accuracy, single precision should be avoided.
(the same test case that generates an error of 8 in single prec, gives an error of e1-9 in double)

I've determined that the most severe errors come from inaccurate eigenvalues;
I do not really know how to deal with this, since much of the calculations are done
to within machine precision, which happens to be too low;

10.17.2012: added power iterations to improve eigenvector accuracy;


---------
4/2013 : C bindings
6/2013 : add bindings for gradients

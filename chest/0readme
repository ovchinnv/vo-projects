3.2013 : beginning integration of fluids code ; these notes outline the current plan

1) some functionality involving the poisson solver and the fluids solver will be shared/merged (such as grids/bc's); these modules will
probably be in a separate directory; the chest/fluids modules will use those modules;

for now, I am creating an "eddie" directory that will house fluids code; as it develops, will see how to rearrange mpre logically

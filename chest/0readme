3.2013 : beginning integration of fluids code ; these notes outline the current plan

1) some functionality involving the poisson solver and the fluids solver will be shared/merged (such as grids/bc's); these modules will
probably be in a separate directory; the chest/fluids modules will use those modules;

for now, I am creating an "eddie" directory that will house fluids code; as it develops, will see how to rearrange mpre logically

Also, for now, the state stores variables in different contexts, but this is just a blueprint for greater flexibility in the future.
Also, I assume the existence of one instance of 'size' which has the dimensions and a communicator (thi sis implicit when you include 'size'); 
in the future, the code should allow multiple communicators associated with different contexts

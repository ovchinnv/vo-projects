11/2012 : this is a very crude implemetation -- perhaps to be cleaned up later
Even when I optimized the application of Projection matrices, the calculation is very slow.
This seems to be caused by the fact that many matrices are still sparse, but the corresponding mutliplications
are done serially ( of course, there is a limit to the benefits from a sparse matrix library because the
inverses are full matrices); a MATLAB script compiled with 'mcc' performs better than the fortran code !

Another possibility is to parallelize the code and run on a supercomputer (e.g. NERSC)
